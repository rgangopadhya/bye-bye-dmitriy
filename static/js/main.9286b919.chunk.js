From Mobility to Explore and data platform, I've always been amazed at how much you know and how collaborative and humble you are at the same time. You really set the standard for what it means to be a Remix engineer, and we will be forever learning from your example! I'll miss your clever wordplay and sense of humor, and just talking to you about music (I hope to hear some of it someday!)"},{name:"Nichole",text:"Dmitry, you are an institution at Remix.
