Also, I really appreciate your help in the ask-an-eng channels - I leaned on you a lot to reprocess countless layers and to get to the bottom of confusing questions, and I always knew I could rely on you.

I was trying to come up with a short pithy summary of what I\u2019ve enjoyed about working with you, and found it impossible, so you\u2019re going to get a list instead: your commitment to understanding customer needs + what\u2019s actually important in a project, your ability to dream about what our product and infrastructure can be + push us towards it, your creative naming of variables, your willingness and flexibility to do what it takes to make something work for either a customer or a teammate, and your constant proactiveness in making sure we have as good an environment to work in and as good a product for our customers.
